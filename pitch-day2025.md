# Pitch-day 2025 for external master's projects in computer science and machine learning

<img src="VI_main_960px-p-500.png" width="250" height="76">

We invite all Norwegian companies, the public sector, and other organizations to present your ideas for master’s projects for the computer science and machine learning students at UiT. We especially encourage local companies and startups to join.

This is a great opportunity to connect with students having an interest and background in computer science/engineering and machine learning. Presenting your company and AI or ICT projects may help find relevant students and future employees. By offering a master project and recruiting a student for 6 to 12 months you can strengthen your team, get a new perspective on your projects, transmit your values and possibly find a new employee.

The event is hosted by the [Digital Technology Innovation Lab](https://uit-dtil.github.io/) and [SFI Visual Intelligence](https://www.visual-intelligence.no/) at the Departments of [Computer Science](https://uit.no/enhet/ifi) and [Physics and Technology](https://uit.no/enhet/ift). The event will be on the **20th of March from 14:00-16:00**. The companies and organizations are invited to give a short in person presentation to the students at UiT.

## How to participate

If you are interested in having UiT master students doing their final year project with you, we ask you to register by [filling this form](https://forms.office.com/e/J5nGKteK78). You will be asked to provide the following information:
1. Name and email of your contact person(s) 
2. A brief introduction of the company or organization 
3. A short text describing the project(s) you want to propose


We plan to make this information available to all students (unless you want to keep it confidential). The **deadline for registration is 18th of March**. We will provide feedback and invite those suitable for a master’s project to give a pitch at the event. We will select the presenters on a "first come first served" basis but prioritize startups and local companies.
