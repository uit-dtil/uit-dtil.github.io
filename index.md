# About

The *digital technology innovation lab* aims to improve the number of successful research based startups from the UiT The Arctic University of Norway. Especially we want more students to both do startups and be involved in entrepreneurship. We provide an environment and support for pre-commercial projects, where we work on and welcome ideas from researchers in computer science, machine learning, and other fields where computation and software is an essential part. We also welcome software based startup ideas from all students at UiT.

The Lab provides a physical place where students can meet to work together on developing their tech startup concept. With an innovation leader based on-site we are active in helping you develop the right startup concept, gain validation and support for the idea, build up a complimenting founder team and advise on prototyping and tech development. The ultimate goal is securing financing for the tech startup and here the Lab team can help with putting together a development plan, financing plan and application pitch for financing. 

If you have a research project with commercial potential, a student and want to be involved in the lab activities, or you have other ideas for startups, **get in touch** to hear more about opportunities we have right now or to discuss an idea you would like to develop. We facilitate student involvement in the form of small projects, bachelor, special curriculum, or master projects.
